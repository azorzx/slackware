# All packages in that list will be shown but
# unchecked by default
#
# You can greylist using regular expressions.
#
# Don't use *full* regex here, because all of the following
# will be checked for the regex: series, name, version, arch,
# build, fullname and repository name.
#
# Also you may want to greylist ALL slackpkgplus repository;
# useful if you want to run slackpkg install alienbob and select
# only the wanted package (instead de-select all unwanted):
#SLACKPKGPLUS_.*
#
# You may want to greylist kde and/or kdei
#kde
#kdei
