===================

Here's a list of known problems and bugs in MLED and MLES. If you think you
have found a bug, don't hesitate to let my know by either sending me an email
or posting a message on LinuxQuestions.org.

[ ] = pending
[X] = solved

MLED 14.0

MIME type associations are sometimes handled incorrectly. If you click for
example Places -> Home folder from the top MATE menu, you'll get Easytag or
another seemingly random application like Audacious opened. 

set the Preferred Applications -> System -> File Manager back to "Caja" from
"Easytag" or "Audacious" to get the normal/default behaviour back.
