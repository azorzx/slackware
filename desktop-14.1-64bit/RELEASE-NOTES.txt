Choice of desktop environment
-----------------------------

MLED is now firmly based on the Xfce desktop environment. Over the last two
years, the project has undergone quite a few respins based on other desktop
environments like KDE and MATE. While these successive versions were not bad
technically speaking, I had to make a decision based on a series of factors
like perennity, popularity, lack of manpower, etc. I opted for one single
desktop environment, namely Xfce, and decided to concentrate on quality rather
than quantity. Ironically, this is also a move back to the roots. The very
first avatar of this project, dating back to 2006, was called "Slick Linux"
at the time and was based on Slackware 12.0 and Xfce 4.4.
