The following HOWTO describes how to switch desktops on an existing Microlinux
Enterprise Desktop installation.


From Xfce to KDE
----------------

Switch to init 3:

  # init 3 

Login as root and update information about available packages:

  # slackpkg update 

Remove any additional MLED packages:

  # slackpkg remove desktop-extra 

Remove all Xfce-specific MLED packages:

  # slackpkg remove desktop-xfce 

Update the Microlinux scripts:

  # cd ~/slackware 
  # git pull 

Trim the base Slackware installation by running the 'trim_desktop_kde.sh'
script. This will remove all Xfce-related packages and install everything
that's needed for a functional KDE desktop:

  # cd desktop-kde-$VERSION-$ARCH/tools 
  # ./trim_desktop_kde.sh 

  Note: $VERSION is your version of Slackware (like 14.1), and $ARCH is the
  architecture of your CPU (either 32-bit or 64-bit).

Install all KDE-specific MLED packages:

  # slackpkg install desktop-kde 

Install the custom menu entries by running the 'cleanmenu.sh' script in the
same directory:

  # ./cleanmenu.sh 

Since your user is already created, his default profile will have to be copied
over manually from /etc/skel:

  # su - <youruser> 
  $ cp -Rvf /etc/skel/.[!.]* . 

  /!\ Don't simply use a .* wildcard on hidden files, otherwise you'll fill
  your home directory with the contents of /etc.

Now switch back to init 4 and login to KDE:

  $ exit 
  # init 4

Now switch back to init 4 and login to Xfce:

  $ exit 
  # init 4
