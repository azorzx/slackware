Microlinux Enterprise Desktop & Server
--------------------------------------

Welcome to the Microlinux Enterprise Desktop (MLED) and Server (MLES). These
projects provide extra software for Slackware Linux through a series of three
different sets of repositories:

  1. [desktop]
  ------------

  This is the main repository for the Xfce-based Microlinux Enterprise
  Desktop. It contains various desktop requirements like multimedia libraries,
  plugins and codecs, fonts and translation files as well as popular
  applications like LibreOffice, Transmission, Inkscape, Scribus, Audacity,
  Openshot, enhanced versions of MPlayer and Audacious and many more.


  2. [extras]
  -----------

  This repository provides extra software for specific purposes, like
  VirtualBox, Dropbox, Remmina, Easytag, Filezilla, etc. A full MLED
  installation is required for these packages to work correctly.


  3. [server]
  -----------
  
  Extra server software for Slackware, mostly stuff that I'm using on my
  production servers, and that I've packaged for convenience: Postfix,
  Dovecot, Postgrey, Squid, SquidGuard, Glances, MPD, Icecast, ...


Complete sources and build scripts are included. Binary packages are provided
for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
