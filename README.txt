Microlinux Enterprise Desktop & Server
--------------------------------------

Welcome to the Microlinux Enterprise Desktop (MLED) and Server (MLES). These
projects provide extra software for Slackware Linux through a series of five
different sets of repositories:

  1. desktop-base: desktop-agnostic extra software for Slackware. These
  packages are common to the KDE-based MLED standard edition as well as the
  Xfce-based MLED-lite edition. If you're using a different desktop
  environment like MATE (from the MATE SlackBuilds project), Enlightenment,
  Openbox, Fluxbox or WindowMaker, you can still use this repository. It
  contains a wide selection of multimedia libraries, plugins and codecs,
  fonts, translation files and popular applications like LibreOffice,
  Transmission, Inkscape, Scribus, Audacity, Openshot, an enhanced version of
  MPlayer and more.

  2. desktop-kde: KDE-specific extra software for Slackware. Use this
  repository for the KDE-based MLED standard edition. You must have the full
  set of packages from desktop-base installed.

  3. desktop-xfce: Xfce-specific extra software for Slackware. This repository
  contains packages for the Xfce-based MLED Light edition. Likewise, it
  depends on a full installation of the desktop-base repository.

  4. desktop-extra: additional software for MLED, mostly applications for
  specific purposes like VirtualBox, Filezilla, Poedit, Easytag, aMule or
  Kdenlive. They depend on a full installation of either MLED or MLED Light.

  5. server: extra server software for Slackware, mostly stuff that I'm using
  on my production servers, and that I've packaged for convenience: Postfix,
  Dovecot, Postgrey, Squid, SquidGuard, Glances, MPD, Icecast, ...

Complete sources, build scripts and documentation are included, and binary
packages are provided for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
